# SPI Protocol Design (Verilog)

This project implements **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** protocol in Verilog HDL along with RTL simulation, timing verification, and testbench validation.

## 🚀 Features
- SPI Master design
- Clock generation (SCLK)
- MOSI/MISO communication logic
- Configurable clock polarity and phase
- Fully verified with testbench

## 📁 File Structure (to be added)
- `spi_master.v`
- `spi_tb.v`
- `waveforms/`

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado / ModelSim
- Verilog HDL
- Post-synthesis timing checks

## 📚 Description
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol widely used to transmit data between microcontrollers and sensors.

More details will be added soon.
